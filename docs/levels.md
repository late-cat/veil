***level 1:

The prompt explained in the video is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DWYHc7q_e_qFfe0JeszqIMpSAf2S0cMwbPVOpPs4BU/edit?usp=sharing).
In the new moon, the sky holds the moon entirely in shadow — present, but unseen. That is where you begin. You stand up your toolchain, write your first contract in Compact, and deploy to Preview/Preprod. Nothing is public yet, and nothing needs to be.
Your mission this cycle: Toolchain set up, first Compact contract written and deployed on Preview/Preprod, plus an initial idea.
Who Can Join?
Open to everyone. A good fit if you are curious about building privacy-first applications on Midnight, have basic frontend or full-stack experience, and enjoy learning by building real, shipped things.
What You Will Learn?
Installing the Midnight toolchain (Compact compiler, proof server, Node 22, Docker),
Writing a Compact contract with public ledger state and a private witness,
Using disclose() deliberately to control what becomes public,
Compiling to ZK circuits and deploying to Preprod.
Requirements to Pass
Toolchain installed and a contract that compiles via compact compile,
Passing test suite,
Generated managed/ directory present (circuits + keys),
Contract deployed to Preview or Preprod with a visible contract address,
An initial product idea (1 short paragraph) drafted in the README,
Minimum 5 meaningful commits.
Submission Checklist
Public GitHub repository with a README.md,
Setup instructions (how to run locally),
Screenshot: successful compile output (circuits listed),
Screenshot: contract deployed with address shown,
README section explaining public state vs private witness,
Initial product idea paragraph,
Minimum 5 meaningful commits.
🌑 Level 1 — New Moon: No prize — this is the entry level. Complete it to unlock the prize track from Level 2 onward.


***level 2:
Who Can Join?
Open to developers who have completed Level 1 or have equivalent experience, with a deployed Compact contract and readiness to learn the Midnight.js SDK and DApp connector.
What You Will Learn
Midnight.js SDK and the DApp connector API,
Connecting and disconnecting the Lace wallet,
Calling a circuit from the frontend and handling its result,
Managing local private state; deploying to Preprod.
Requirements to Pass
Lace wallet connect / disconnect implemented,
Circuit called successfully from the frontend,
An observable privacy behavior (something proven without being shown),
Contract deployed to Preprod with a verifiable address,
Minimum 8 meaningful commits.
Submission Checklist
Public GitHub repository with README,
Live demo link (Vercel, Netlify, or similar),
Deployed Preprod contract address (verifiable on-chain),
Demo video: wallet connect + a successful circuit call,
README documenting the privacy claim,
Minimum 8 meaningful commits.

***level:3
Who Can Join? 
Open to developers who have completed Level 2, with a frontend dApp wired to a deployed contract, understanding of circuits, wallet connection, and private state.
What You Will Learn
Designing a dApp around selective disclosure,
Writing contract and application tests,
Setting up a CI/CD pipeline (compile + test on every push),
Scoping a realistic product proposal.
Provided Idea List (choose one)
Private Voting — anonymous ballots with publicly verifiable tallies,
Age / Eligibility Gate — prove a threshold without revealing the underlying value,
Private Allowlist Access — prove membership without revealing identity,
Confidential Credentials — prove a credential is valid without disclosing it,
Sealed-Bid Auction — private bids, verifiable winner,
Private Payroll / Splits — distribute funds without exposing amounts,
Anonymous Feedback / Survey — verifiable participation, private responses.
Requirements to Pass
Fully functional dApp that meaningfully uses Midnight’s privacy model,
Minimum 3 tests passing,
CI/CD pipeline running (workflow file + passing runs),
Approved idea submitted from the provided idea list,
Minimum 10 meaningful commits.
Submission Checklist
Public GitHub repository with complete README,
Live demo link,
Screenshot: test output (3+ tests passing),
CI/CD badge or workflow file with passing runs,
Demo video (1 minute) showing full functionality,
README “privacy model” section: what an observer can and cannot learn,
Product proposal (from the idea list) submitted for approval,
Minimum 10 meaningful commits.
💰 At the end of the monthly review period, selected winners will receive a prize based on the quality of their submission, and each winner will receive $30.
